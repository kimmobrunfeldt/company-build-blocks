# Company build blocks

Pieces of information to help founding a (coding) company. These building blocks would be my personal choices. I'll list the best option to my mind first.

## Hour tracking

* [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/)
* [Timely](http://www.timelyapp.com/)

## Intranet

Depends on employees. If all of them are very technical, you could go with simple markdown like GitHub repository.

Other options:

* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
* [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

## Documents

* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)

## File share
